When run, SARSA Lambda agents with varying lambda values estimate their Q-Values over 500 episodes.
The history of the Q-Values as heat maps using the colour map Greens for each agent's episodes is outputed to .png files in the directory where the .ipynb file is stored.

The Q-Values are normalized across episodes for each agent and prepackaged heat maps are found in the Scaled Images Greens folder along with an animation of them in the base directory called Scaled Greens.webm
Unnormalized heat maps are prepackaged in the Non-Scaled Images Magma folder and use the Magma colour map. An animation for these is also provided in the base directory and is called Non-Scaled Magma.webm
