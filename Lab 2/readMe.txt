When run, the bar graph for the comparison between the random and greedy agent (Using the optimal value function) of the total reward averaged for 20 runs is shown first.
Then upon closing the graph, the heat maps graph showing a sample run of the trajectories of the agents is shown.
When this graph is closed, greater detail of the agents' trajectories is printed to the console.
